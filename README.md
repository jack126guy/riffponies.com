# RiffPonies.com

RiffPonies.com is a joke website for [RiffPonies](https://twitter.com/RiffPonies) created during [TrotCon Online: Snow Day](https://trotcononline.net/) in December 2020.

The (then-fictitious) website RiffPonies.com was offered as a response during the ["JackBox with The Stars: Snowed-In Edition!" event](https://vimeo.com/483909182). (The response first appears at 35:53 in the video, although it is covered by the players' camera views at first.) The RiffPonies members and other players then joked about the possible contents of the site, especially merchandise, which have been incorporated into the real site. Since then, this site has been augmented with additional jokes.

The site is available at [the expected domain name](https://riffponies.com/) as well as on [GitHub Pages](https://jack126guy.github.io/riffponies.com/).
