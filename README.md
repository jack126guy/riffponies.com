# RiffPonies.com

RiffPonies.com is a joke website for [RiffPonies](https://twitter.com/RiffPonies) created during [TrotCon Online: Snow Day](https://trotcononline.net/) in December 2020. During the ["JackBox with The Stars: Snowed-In Edition!" event](https://vimeo.com/483909182), the (then-fictitious) website RiffPonies.com was offered as a response to a prompt in the game Bracketeering. The RiffPonies members and other players then joked about the possible contents of the site, especially merchandise. (The response first appears at 35:53 in the video, although it is covered by the players' camera views at first).
